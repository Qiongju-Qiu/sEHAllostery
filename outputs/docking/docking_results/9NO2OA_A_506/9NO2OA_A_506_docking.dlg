		CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF CONFORMATIONS
		_________________________________

Number of conformations = 10

RMSD cluster analysis will be performed using the ligand atoms only (0 / 30 total atoms).

Outputting structurally similar clusters, ranked in order of increasing energy.


________________________________________________________________________________

Number of distinct conformational clusters found = 1,  out of 10 runs,
Using an rmsd-tolerance of 2.0 A
